# **INFO** 

### Minecraft:
###### I have discovered a way to import worlds onto your school Chromebook via a USB flash drive. If you have a copy of the world on the USB flash drive, simply plug it into your school Chromebook, click "Create New World", and then select "Import Vanilla World". After that, choose the file of the world you want to play, and you're all set.

###### Unfortunately, I have yet to find a way to download world files from your school Chromebook onto a USB flash drive. This is an issue because every time you try to download something while using the CollageBoard exploit, it disappears from your downloads folder before you even have a chance to open it.

###### Hopefully, in the future, I will discover a method that allows you to save worlds, so you can play in between periods. Trust me, I understand how frustrating it can be when you've made significant progress in the world, only for your Chromebook to die or for you to suddenly have to exit CollageBoard. It’s really annoying, but maybe I can figure out another exploit that works better...

###### I’m not sure how two players would be able to play Minecraft together in different classes. This is because you need a code to join the other player, and without using other devices, there’s no way for one player to share the code with the other. If you go into the chat room, the code has already expired. This will be a problem in the upcoming semester.

### **D.W.O.S.W**  
##### -DOESN'T WORK ON SCHOOL WIFI
###### D.W.O.S.W. simply means that a specific website will not work while you are connected to the school's Wi-Fi. These websites are blocked on all devices through your county's firewall. This means that if you connect to the school Wi-Fi with your phone and try to access these websites, they will most likely be blocked. However, you can still access these websites as long as you are connected to a Wi-Fi network outside of the school.
