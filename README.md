# **INFO** 

### Minecraft:
###### I have discovered that there is a way to import worlds onto your school chromebook via USB flash drive. If you have a copy of these worlds on a USB flash drive, you can simply plug it into your school chromebook, click **"Create New World"**, and then go ahead and click on **"Import Vanilla World"**. After that, select the file of the world you want to play on, and there you go.

###### Sadly, I have yet to find out a way to download world files from you school chromebook onto a USB flash drive. This is an issue because everytime you try and download something while in the *CollageBoard* exploit, it vanishes from your downloads folder before you even get the chance to open it. 

###### Hopefully sometime in the future I will discover a method that will allow you to save worlds, letting you play in between periods. Trust me, I understand how frustrating it can be when you've progressed so far in the world and then either your chromebook dies or you suddenly have to exit *CollageBoard*. It sucks, maybe I can figure out another exploit that works better...
